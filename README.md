Solution:   AtriumOpt <br />

## Goal

Create a system that, through a connect service of Python and SQL, can create and manipulate the website Atrium and keep track of several card simultaneously and reliably.

## Systems and Libraries Being Utilized

<ol>
	<li> Python 3.10 </li>
		<ul>
			<li> MySQL Connector (pip install)</li>
			<li> Pandas </li>
			<li> Selenium Driver </li>
		</ul>
	<li> MySQL </li>
</ol>

## Notes

This project is manly so that I can understand SQL and python on a deeper level and create my first inter-language project.

Additionally, this will also be used as a way of more efficiently perform operation in the Atrium website, which I will be working with in the future.

The actual Atrium Crawler was created a year ago, but it is very simple and does not make for a very reliable code. I will be rewriting parts of it once I have a better understanding of the future of this project
